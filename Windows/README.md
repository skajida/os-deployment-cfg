#### Creating a bootable USB drive

Download [Rufus 3.18](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v3.18/rufus-3.18.exe) to burn an `.iso` image to your USB stick.

Select your drive and path to `.iso` image, partition scheme â€“ `MBR`.

Click `START`, after that be ready to lose all data on your flash drive.
