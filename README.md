# OS instructions

This project was created to simplify the deployment of your own environment within the framework of using a specific distribution (or operating system).

## Linux distributions

* [Fedora 36](Linux/fedora36)
* [Pop!_OS 20.04](Linux/pop_os2004)
* [Ubuntu 18.04](Linux/ubuntu1804)

## To-Do list
